## HTML Page & CSS Styling

**HTML Page**: Contains header, three sections, & footer:

1.  **<header>:** includes a `<h1>` tag for heading & `<nav`> tag for navbar('profile', 'about', 'contact')

    - **CSS**:

      - used Google font `Syne Mono` and used `span` tag inside `h1` to give different colors to each word.

      - `<nav>` includes `<ul>` list `<li>` of links `<a>` with `href` attribute as same as `#id` this will cause the browser to scroll to that element on the page.

      - used `:hover` property of `<a>` tag, to style the `cursor` as `grab` cursor also used `transition` for more styling on color when hover on links.
